# mixed_messages_CCproject
Codecademy project focused on JS

Project Description: 
* Build a message generator program using JS
* Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. 
* Output message should be made up of at least three different pieces of data. 

What should happen when program is run: 
Random workout message will generate for the user.

How Project will work: 
1. Multiple arrays with random values will be prepopulated to include (running distance, number of reps, terrain type)
2. Function will be used to select three random values in the arrays. 
3. 3 total messages will be provided to the user. If any are repeats, a new message will be created. 

Tasks to complete:
1. Create arrays of preloaded options. 
2. Create function to select a random item in each string, return the string with variables included. 
3. Create function returning an array of 3 messages, ensuring no repeats. 
4. Run function at end of program. 
5. Test
